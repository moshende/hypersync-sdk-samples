# This sample demonstrates how to use the siem endpoint in the
# REST API.

# This sample is interactive.

# For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
# sample is being run against.
# THIS SAMPLE WILL MAKE CHANGES TO THE OFFENSE IT IS RUN AGAINST
# The scenario demonstrates the following actions:
#  - How to get offenses
#  - How to get a single offense given the ID
#  - How to get notes from an offense
#  - How to make a new note for an offense

# To view a list of the endpoints with the parameters they accept, you can view
# the REST API interactive help page on your deployment at
# https://<hostname>/api_doc.  You can also retrieve a list of available
# endpoints with the REST API itself at the /api/help/endpoints endpoint.
