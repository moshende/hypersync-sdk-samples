# This sample demonstrates how to use the siem endpoint in the
# REST API.

# For this scenario to work there must already be offenses on the system the
# sample is being run against.  The scenario demonstrates the following
# actions:
#  - How to get offenses.
#  - How to filter the data that is returned with the fields parameter.
#  - How to filter the data that is returned with the filter parameter.
#  - How to page through the results using the range parameter.

# To view a list of the endpoints with the parameters they accept, you can view
# the REST API interactive help page on your deployment at
# https://<hostname>/api_doc.  You can also retrieve a list of available
# endpoints with the REST API itself at the /api/help/endpoints endpoint.

    # any parameters. This will print absolutely everything it can find, every
    # parameter of every offense.

    # endpoint there will be a lot of fields displayed which you have no
    # interest in. Here, the fields parameter will make sure the only the
    # fields you want are displayed for each offense.

    # after the call by the value of the fields.
